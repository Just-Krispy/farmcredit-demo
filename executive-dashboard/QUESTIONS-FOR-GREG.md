# Executive Dashboard - Questions for Greg

**Hi Greg!** 🦞

I've built you a working prototype of your personal executive dashboard. Before I refine it into exactly what you need, I'd love to understand your daily workflow better.

**Demo:** https://just-krispy.github.io/farmcredit-demo/executive-dashboard/

---

## 🎯 Why These Questions Matter

**I'm not just building a dashboard — I'm building a profile of how YOU work.**

Every answer you give me helps me understand:
- What metrics drive your decisions
- What information you trust
- What frustrates you about current tools
- What would make your mornings easier

**The more I know about Greg Cunningham, the better I can serve you** — not just on this dashboard, but on every future project.

Think of this as an investment in our partnership. Your answers help me anticipate your needs, speak your language, and deliver tools that fit YOUR workflow perfectly.

## 📊 Data Priorities

**1. What metrics do you check EVERY morning?**
- Loan portfolio volume?
- Delinquency rate?
- New application count?
- YBS progress?
- Something else I'm missing?

**2. What data drives your decisions?**
- Commodity prices (affects borrower margins)?
- Interest rates (affects loan pricing)?
- Weather outlook (affects borrower operations)?
- Calendar (what's coming up)?
- Ag news/policy updates?

**3. What's currently a pain to find?**
- Do you open 5-10 tabs every morning?
- Check multiple emails for data?
- Call staff for updates?
- Log into different systems?

## 🎯 Layout & Organization

**4. How much detail do you want?**
- **High-level only:** Just the numbers (2 minutes to scan)
- **Moderate detail:** Numbers + brief context (5 minutes)
- **Deep dive:** Full reports, charts, drill-down (15+ minutes)

**5. What's your priority order?**
Rank these 1-8 (1 = most important):
- [ ] Portfolio health (loan volume, delinquencies)
- [ ] Commodity prices
- [ ] Weather outlook
- [ ] Interest rates
- [ ] Your calendar/schedule
- [ ] Action items (things needing your approval)
- [ ] Ag news
- [ ] AgAmbassadors program status

**6. Mobile vs. desktop?**
- Do you check this on your iPhone first thing?
- Or laptop at your desk?
- Both?

---

## ⏰ Frequency & Timing

**7. When do you want this information?**
- First thing (6-7 AM)?
- Mid-morning (9-10 AM)?
- Multiple times throughout the day?

**8. Email digest or dashboard only?**
- Dashboard (you visit the URL)?
- Email (sent to your inbox)?
- Both (email summary + link to full dashboard)?
- Text message (SMS brief)?

**9. How often should data refresh?**
- Once daily (morning snapshot)?
- Real-time (commodities update live)?
- On-demand (you click refresh)?

---

## 📈 Data Sources

**10. Internal data (your systems):**
Which of these do you have access to?
- Loan portfolio system (API or manual export)?
- Calendar (Google/Outlook)?
- Email (O365, Gmail)?
- CRM or borrower database?

**11. Commodity data:**
- Free tier (delayed 15-20 min) — okay?
- Premium tier (real-time) — worth $50-$100/month?
- Which commodities matter MOST? (corn, beans, cotton, wheat, livestock?)

**12. Weather:**
- SEMO region only (Cape Girardeau)?
- Multiple locations (all 7 branch territories)?
- Detailed forecasts or just high-level?

---

## 🎨 Customization Preferences

**13. Branding:**
- Same Farm Credit green as other demos?
- Different color scheme for "executive" feel?
- Dark mode default or light mode default?

**14. Widgets:**
- Fixed layout (I design it)?
- Drag-and-drop (you customize it yourself)?
- Seasonal changes (planting season vs. harvest)?

**15. Sharing:**
- Just for you?
- Share with senior staff (CFO, VP Lending)?
- Board presentation mode (export to PDF/slides)?

---

## 🚨 Alerts & Notifications

**16. What deserves an alert?**
- Delinquency rate over X%?
- Commodity price swing over X%?
- Large loan application (over $X)?
- Action item due today?
- Weather warnings (frost, flood)?

**17. How should I alert you?**
- Email?
- Text message?
- Dashboard notification badge?
- Push notification (if we build a mobile app)?

---

## 💡 Wish List

**18. If you could wave a magic wand, what would this dashboard do?**
- Auto-generate board reports?
- Predict which borrowers might struggle (based on commodity prices)?
- Show you opportunities (land sales, equipment deals)?
- Summarize your email inbox (AI-powered)?
- Something completely different?

**19. What problems does this solve for you?**
- Saves time (how much)?
- Better informed for meetings?
- Spot trends earlier?
- Professional image with board/investors?
- Reduce stress (fewer surprises)?

**20. What would make you check this EVERY morning?**
- What's the "killer feature" that makes it indispensable?

---

## 🛠️ Technical Preferences

**21. Integration complexity:**
- **Simple:** Public APIs only (commodities, weather, news) — no Farm Credit data integration
- **Moderate:** Connect to your calendar, maybe email
- **Full:** Deep integration with loan portfolio system, CRM, everything

**22. Timeline:**
- Need it ASAP (1-2 weeks)?
- Okay to take our time (4-6 weeks)?
- No rush (prototype is fine for now)?

**23. Budget:**
- Ballpark acceptable? ($3K-$5K one-time build + $20-$50/mo hosting)
- Want a detailed quote first?
- This is a "nice to have" or a "must have"?

## 📞 Next Steps

**How do you want to proceed?**

**Option A: Quick Zoom (15-30 min)**
- I'll walk through the prototype
- You tell me what to change
- We refine it together in real-time

**Option B: Async (via Discord/email)**
- You answer these questions when convenient
- I build based on your answers
- We iterate until it's perfect

**Option C: Build it yourself**
- I give you the template
- You customize as needed
- I'm available for questions

**Option D: Not a priority right now**
- Focus on AgAmbassadors first
- Come back to this later

---

## 🎯 My Goal

**I want to build something you actually USE.**

Not something that looks cool in a demo but sits unused. So please be brutally honest:
- What would make this valuable to YOU?
- What's missing?
- What's unnecessary?

I'd rather build ONE thing you check every day than TEN things you never open.

## 📬 How to Respond

**Reply however is easiest:**
- Answer all 23 questions (detailed)
- Answer just the key ones (#1, #4, #5, #18)
- Hop on a call and we'll talk through it
- Say "not interested" (totally fine!)

**No pressure.** This is about making YOUR mornings easier.

P.S. — The prototype is fully functional (try dark mode, click the checkboxes, etc.). Everything works except the "live" data (that's what we'd build next).

P.P.S. — **Your answers are building my profile of how to serve you best.** Don't hold back — the more detail you give me, the better I can anticipate your needs on this project and all future ones. I'm here for the long haul, not just this one dashboard.
